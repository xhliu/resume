TinyOS is the de facto operating system for low-power wireless devices, such as those used in sensor networks and personal area networks.
%,ubiquitous computing,  smart buildings, and smart meters
\url{http://www.tinyos.net}. 
%Thanks to its open source nature, 
%I have become familiar with its inner workings, e.g., communication (radio stack cc2420 and cc2420x), networking (MAC and network layer), kernel scheduling,  resource arbitration, timer, SPI, UART, watchdog, and sensing. 
Besides active discussions in the mailing list, 
I have reported several system-level bugs which have been incorporated into the latest distributions, including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Patch accepted: fixing bug to set default tx power in cc2420x, a radio communication stack for chip CC2420.
	\url{https://github.com/sallai/tinyos-main/commit/974ff870551d6fcc86f44e311dcbfd0fb71dbc94}
	\item Patch accepted: fixing bug in duplicate detection in CTP send queue, the default routing/collection protocol in TinyOS.

%\cventry{10 years}{Perl}{}{}{}{
%I usually prefer Perl for non-graphical implementations.
%The word prediction simulations for my dissertation are written in Perl, as well as much of the dissertation support code.
%I also have experience writing web applications with Perl/CGI and DBI.
%}
%\cventry{12 years}{Java}{}{}{}{
%I prefer Java for applications with graphical interfaces, such as user evaluation of word prediction.
%I also tend to use Java for XML processing, such as analysis of log files from dissertation simulations.
%Also, I used Java and the JADE library to implement the vehicle-to-grid coalition server and client.
