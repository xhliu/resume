I recently defended my Ph. D. dissertation on predictable and reliable wireless networking. During my six years of graduate study, I have designed and implemented highly scalable, fully distributed, multi-threaded, and object-oriented robust software for wireless networked embedded systems. More specifically, I have implemented over ten protocols/applications, in excess of $\textbf{\textit{80,000}}$ lines, from the ground up all by myself and thoroughly deployed and evaluated all in two real-world testbeds of 127+ nodes. All this hands-on experience has familiarized me with object-oriented programming and design, client/server architecture, and peer-to-peer architecture.
Besides, I have published the results in the form of papers in top-notch networking conferences and journals. I also presented papers to international experts at several conferences.
