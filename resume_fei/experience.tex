% what is this project about, how does it achieve its goal, what's the result?
National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) project
\begin{itemize}
	% too general
	% "Conduct statistical analyses:" what specific analysis/tools/techniques used
	% "longitudinal database:" what concrete data from the database, how large
	% "in SAS:" what SAS features u used
	\item Conduct statistical analyses for technical reports and research studies using NAEPâ€™s large scale longitudinal database in SAS
	% -> performed X, Y, and Z analysis of 200 MB of A data using SAS's Macro; results are incorporated into 5 research studies on blahblah
	\item Conduct technical review of NAEP data file, report and technical documentation for statistical, psychometric methodological accuracy
\end{itemize}
Common Core of Data survey project (CCD)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create SAS code to review and edit preliminary data collected from the National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data nonfiscal Surveys and generated Excel output using SAS/BASE, Macros, PROC SQL and ODS. Imputed missing data item according to the requirement of client
	\item Provide technical support in CCD report development and documentation creation
	\item Conduct Ad-hoc research study and data request using CCD survey data
\end{itemize}
