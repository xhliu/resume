\subsection{Physical-Ratio-K based Scheduling Protocol (PRKS)}
\cvitem{}{
PRKS guarantees the reliability of a wireless link is no less than requirement in the presence of interference while maximizing throughput.
I single-handedly implemented PRKS, its two variants, and four state-of-the-art protocols from the ground up, on resource-constrained sensors using TinyOS. Through measurement studies in two sensor network testbeds, each consisting of 127+ sensors, we observed that PRKS enables predictably high link reliability (95\% vs 0\% in others) . The source code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/xhliu/prks}.

\subsection{Multi-Timescale Adaptation (MTA) Routing Protocol}
\cvitem{}{
MTA identifies minimal energy paths that can meet probabilistic deadlines of real-time traffic, given the notorious dynamics and uncertainties of path delays in wireless networks.
I managed to independently implement the whole protocol, its seven variants, and four other protocols from scratch on sensors using TinyOS. Two testbeds of 127+ sensors have verified MTA's significant advantages over the state of the art for a variety of settings, improving deadline success ratio by 89\% and reducing transmission cost by a factor of 9.7. Code is at \url{https://github.com/xhliu/mta}.

%\cventry{10 years}{Perl}{}{}{}{
%I usually prefer Perl for non-graphical implementations.
%The word prediction simulations for my dissertation are written in Perl, as well as much of the dissertation support code.
%I also have experience writing web applications with Perl/CGI and DBI.
%}
%\cventry{12 years}{Java}{}{}{}{
%I prefer Java for applications with graphical interfaces, such as user evaluation of word prediction.
%I also tend to use Java for XML processing, such as analysis of log files from dissertation simulations.
%Also, I used Java and the JADE library to implement the vehicle-to-grid coalition server and client.

%\cventry{10 years}{C++}{}{}{}{I use C++ mainly for academic purposes --- teaching second-semester programming/design and third-semester data structures as well as certain graduate classes (graphics).}
%
%\cventry{familiarity}{Javascript, Python, Lua}{}{}{}{I've written small proof-of-concept applications in several other languages. Many of my systems involving web data display use Javascript to accomplish small tasks.
