%\subsection{Physical-Ratio-K based Scheduling Protocol (PRKS)}
%\cvitem{}{
%PRKS guarantees the reliability of a wireless link is no less than requirement in the presence of interference while maximizing throughput.
%I single-handedly implemented PRKS, its two variants, and four state-of-the-art protocols from the ground up, on resource-constrained sensors using TinyOS. Through measurement studies in two sensor network testbeds, each consisting of 127+ sensors, we observed that PRKS enables predictably high link reliability (95\% vs 0\% in others) . The source code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/xhliu/prks}.

%\subsection{Multi-Timescale Adaptation (MTA) Routing Protocol}
%\cvitem{}{
%MTA identifies minimal energy paths that can meet probabilistic deadlines of real-time traffic, given the notorious dynamics and uncertainties of path delays in wireless networks.
%I managed to independently implement the whole protocol, its seven variants, and four other protocols from scratch on sensors using TinyOS. Two testbeds of 127+ sensors have verified MTA's significant advantages over the state of the art for a variety of settings, improving deadline success ratio by 89\% and reducing transmission cost by a factor of 9.7. Code is at \url{https://github.com/xhliu/mta}.

TinyOS is the de facto operating system for low-power wireless devices, such as those used in sensor networks and personal area networks.

\url{http://www.tinyos.net}. 
%Thanks to its open source nature, 
I have become familiar with its inner workings, e.g., communication (radio stack cc2420 and cc2420x), networking (MAC and network layer), kernel scheduling,  resource arbitration, timer, SPI, UART, watchdog, and sensing. 
%Besides active discussions in the mailing list, 
I have reported several bugs, including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Patch accepted: fixing bug to set default tx power in cc2420x.
	%, a radio communication stack for chip CC2420.
	\url{https://github.com/sallai/tinyos-main/commit/974ff870551d6fcc86f44e311dcbfd0fb71dbc94}
	\item Patch accepted: fixing bug in duplicate detection in CTP.
	%, the default routing protocol in TinyOS, send queue.

%\subsection{Proficiencies}
%\cventry{10 years}{Perl}{}{}{}{
%I usually prefer Perl for non-graphical implementations.
%The word prediction simulations for my dissertation are written in Perl, as well as much of the dissertation support code.
%I also have experience writing web applications with Perl/CGI and DBI.
%}
%\cventry{12 years}{Java}{}{}{}{
%I prefer Java for applications with graphical interfaces, such as user evaluation of word prediction.
%I also tend to use Java for XML processing, such as analysis of log files from dissertation simulations.
%Also, I used Java and the JADE library to implement the vehicle-to-grid coalition server and client.
