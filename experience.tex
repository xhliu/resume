\cventry{4/12 -- 4/14}{Physical-Ratio-K based Scheduling Protocol (PRKS)}{Research Assistant}{Wayne State University}{MI}{
PRKS is the first-ever practical distributed scheduler to 
ensure reliability of wireless communication while maximizing throughput, eliminating the fundamental decade-old hidden-terminal issue.
% in wireless communication. is no less than requirement in the presence of interference while maximizing throughput.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed the architecture of PRKS: split code into reusable encapsulated components, grouped components wth coupled functionalities, and organized groups in a tree hierarchy.
	\item Implemented, single-handedly, PRKS, its two variants, and four state-of-the-art protocols from scratch, on sensors with only 48kB ROM, 10kB RAM, and 8MHz 16-bit MCU using TinyOS. The source code ($\sim$\textbf{58,000} lines) is available at \url{https://github.com/xhliu/prks}.
	%\item Debugged and ensured the correctness of these distributed concurrent protocols running in two wireless sensor network testbeds of 127+ nodes, with serial port access only.
	\item Deployed these protocols in two sensor network testbeds of 127+ nodes.
	\item Increased link reliability from as low as 0\% in the state of the art to 95\% in PRKS.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{9/09 -- 3/12}{Multi-Timescale Adaptation (MTA) Routing Protocol}{Research Assistant}{Wayne State University}{MI}{
MTA is the best distributed routing protocol for delivering probabilistic real-time traffic.
% identifies minimal energy paths that meet probabilistic deadlines of real-time traffic, taming dynamics and uncertainties of path delays in wireless networks.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implemented, independently, MTA, its seven variants, and four other protocols from the ground up in TinyOS. Code ($\sim$\textbf{16,000} lines) is at \url{https://github.com/xhliu/mta}.
	\item Modified TinyOS kernals systematically to make code run concurrently and enable real-time computing, including radio stack, time synchronization, and resource arbitration.
	\item Increased deadline success ratio by 89\% and reduced transmission cost by a factor of 9.7, shown by measurements in two testbeds of 127+ nodes.

\cventry{2/09 -- 5/09}{LifeCode}{Technical Team Member}{LifeCode Health}{MI}{
LifeCode is a remote health monitoring system to compete in Microsoft Imagine Cup.
%A wearable sensor measures biometric parameters such as heartbeat rate and transmits the data to a mobile phone. The phone processes and displays the data locally, which also uploads it to servers so health care professionals can access it via a web interface.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Built a Windows mobile phone application in C\# to receive and display real-time heartbeat rates collected by wearable sensors and transmitted to the phone via Bluetooth.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{11/08 -- 5/09}{CSC1000 Ticketing System}{System Administrator}{Wayne State University}{MI}{
Students in lab course CSC1000 report machine breakdowns by filing tickets in this web-based system, where IT personnel can track and update the status of each ticket.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Modified database schema and wrote PHP code to enable users to insert, update, delete, search, and dump tickets online
	% via a web interface 
	using the Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) stack.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{12/07 -- 3/08}{Microsoft Forefront Security (MFS)}{Software Engineer Intern}{Wicresoft Company}{China}{
MFS is a business antivirus software product that can be controlled over the network.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wrote test cases and tested MFS on different Windows families, architectures, and languages.
	\item Automated tests using MS-DOS scripting to run MFS on remote machines with various above configurations.
\end{itemize}
