More specifically, my responsibilities as a research assistant include the following.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define research problems in real-time reliable wireless scheduling and routing and propose solutions.
	\item Evaluate solutions by implementing protocols/software using nesC, a variant of embedded C; run them in simulators using TOSSIM and gdb or real-life testbeds using TinyOS.
	\item Parse, analyze, present/visualize large amount of data collected from simulations and testbeds using Matlab.
	\item Write papers using \LaTeX to present our findings.
