% including implementing over ten protocols verified in real-world testbeds of 127+ nodes. One salient feature of these protocols is that their performance is guaranteed and provable since their design and implementation are not based on heuristics or ad hoc techniques, but on rigorous theoretical underpinnings such as probability theory, statistics, Markov decision process, and control theory. My objective is to find a position where I can apply my  systems and theory skills to solve grand real-life challenges.}
