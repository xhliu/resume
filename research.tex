%\cvline{}{Wireless networks, sensor networks}
\cvline{}{I have over six years of hands-on experience in developing distributed, embedded, and real-time wireless networking protocols/software, including implementing over ten protocols verified in real-world testbeds of 127+ nodes. One salient feature of these protocols is that their performance is guaranteed and provable since their design and implementation are not based on heuristics or ad hoc techniques, but on rigorous theoretical underpinnings such as probability theory, statistics, Markov decision process, and control theory. My objective is to find a position where I can apply my  systems and theory skills to solve grand real-life challenges.}
%\cvline{}{\textbf{Wireless and Sensor Networks}: MAC, routing, and cross-layer protocols}
%\cvline{}{\textbf{Wireless Networked Control Systems}: predictable, reliable, and real-time wireless networking for sensing and control}
%\cvline{}{My primary interest lies in predictable and reliable communication for wireless and sensor networks, especially with real-time networking for sensing and control. Vehicular networks, cognitive radios and embedded systems also fascinate me. I work at the confluence of theory and systems, designing MAC, routing, and cross-layer protocols with theoretical foundation as well as empirical considerations.}
%My general research interests include, but are not limited to, wireless networking, sensor networking, cognitive radio, and embedded systems. Currently, my work focuses on reliable and predictable real-time networking for wireless sensing and control.
