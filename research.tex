\section{Summary}
%\section{Objective}
%\cvline{}{Wireless networks, sensor networks}
\cvline{}{I have over six years of experience in developing distributed, embedded, and real-time wireless networking protocols/software, as well as two years in web development.}
% My objective is to find a developer position.}
% where I can apply these skills to solve grand real-life challenges.}
% including implementing over ten protocols verified in real-world testbeds of 127+ nodes. One salient feature of these protocols is that their performance is guaranteed and provable since their design and implementation are not based on heuristics or ad hoc techniques, but on rigorous theoretical underpinnings such as probability theory, statistics, Markov decision process, and control theory. My objective is to find a position where I can apply my  systems and theory skills to solve grand real-life challenges.}
