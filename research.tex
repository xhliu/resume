\cvline{}{\textbf{Wireless Networked Control Systems}: predictable, reliable, and real-time wireless networking for sensing and control}
%\cvline{}{My primary interest lies in predictable and reliable communication for wireless and sensor networks, especially with real-time networking for sensing and control. Vehicular networks, cognitive radios and embedded systems also fascinate me. I work at the confluence of theory and systems, designing MAC, routing, and cross-layer protocols with theoretical foundation as well as empirical considerations.}
%My general research interests include, but are not limited to, wireless networking, sensor networking, cognitive radio, and embedded systems. Currently, my work focuses on reliable and predictable real-time networking for wireless sensing and control.
