\begin{itemize}
	\item 6+ years experience in developing large-scale distributed, embedded, and real-time wireless networking protocols/software
	\item Extreme tenacity, perseverance, and reasoning skills gained through 6+ years of debugging distributed protocols in multi-hop dynamic networks, where bugs are often non-repeatable and timing-dependent caused by, e.g., race conditions and inconsistent distributed states.
	%, or interactions with the physical environment. 
	Worse still, there is no IDE or gdb for networks of resource-constrained embedded devices.

% including implementing over ten protocols verified in real-world testbeds of 127+ nodes. One salient feature of these protocols is that their performance is guaranteed and provable since their design and implementation are not based on heuristics or ad hoc techniques, but on rigorous theoretical underpinnings such as probability theory, statistics, Markov decision process, and control theory. My objective is to find a position where I can apply my  systems and theory skills to solve grand real-life challenges.}
